# Smarter Project

## Introduction
Smarter, is a website where a student can look for a subject they need help with, then see the list of subjects then choose a tutor to have a one-on-one session to help the student with all of his/her confusions and difficulties with any subject. After that, the tutor must create an after-session report in order to track student progress and older lessons.
